Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, the probability of a country winning is not as correlated with the rating provided.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think, at around 10000 simulations, the rankings and winning percentages seem to have stabilized to based on historical data. It's fast enough that it runs in less than a second.
