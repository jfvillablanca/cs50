# This is CS50x 2023

This repo tracks all my lab and problem set solutions that are part of the CS50x 2023 course.

> The solutions presented here can serve as guidance in your CS50 journey. I highly encouraged learners, like me, to make your best attempts at solving problems independently before referring to these solutions.
> Seeking guidance is acceptable; but, it's important to avoid relying on solutions as a mere copy-paste. Understand the logic behind the solutions and write your own implementation.
> The CS50 Academic Honesty statement can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/).

## Motivation

- I took the course as a refresher to computer science fundamentals. A copy of my completion certificate for CS50x can be found here [here](/certificate)
- As a personal challenge and an opportunity to explore new languages, I've provided my implementations of problem sets and labs, including the distribution code typically associated with coding exercises.

## Note

- This does not include my solution to `pset0/scratch`.
- `lab8/trivia`, `pset8/homepage` `lab9/birthdays` are also not included here.
- For my Final Project, here is the [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/JCv4GukldWw) of the video presentation and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jfvillablanca/bourne-task-app).
